## ✨ Features

| Feature                  | Description                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 📝 **Add / Edit Notes**  | Write anything in the textarea and press **Add Note**. Notes are fully _content-editable_ – click any note to update its text. |
| 🗑️ **Delete Notes**      | Each note has a trash icon; one click removes the note.                                                                        |
| 🎨 **Colourful Layout**  | Notes alternate between soft pastel colours for quick visual distinction.                                                      |
| 💾 **Auto-Save**         | All notes are stored in **localStorage**. Additions, edits and deletions are saved automatically.                              |
| ⚠️ **Input Validation**  | An error message prevents empty notes from being added.                                                                        |
| 📱 **Responsive Design** | CSS Grid adapts the layout from mobile to desktop.                                                                             |
| ❤️ **Animated Footer**   | A pulse-animated heart and interactive social icons (GitHub, LinkedIn, Gmail).                                                 |
